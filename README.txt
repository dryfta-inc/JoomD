## Reviews from users

> Like so many other JoomFanatics I was frantically looking for the right com, mod and plg's for one of my applications in 2.5. Well, THIS IS THE ONE!! It covers the most unthinkable options, without even touching the Joomla Core. This component (and the other stuff inside it) will save you SO many time, that my wife even talks to me again :-) In one word: FANTASTIC. Deserves a huge donation and in fact beats a lot of "paid" stuff in the same Category.

> I love this extension! I used to work with Wordpress a lot and then switched to Joomla, so the format was a little new for me. I was surprised at how easy it was to setup and use JoomD. The configuration page is so simple to use. The color-coded on off buttons are quick to read and easy confirm your settings. I'm using JoomD to create a customized directory. I chose this extension because I really like the simplicity of the pages and clean view. So far it's been great. I haven't had any performance issues. I would like to see a few more options, like templates for example, but the one it came with is a good choice. I would certainly recommend this extension to anyone creating a blog or directory of any kind.
